I wrote project 2 in the C Programming Language which first needs to be complie with the first - 
command provided below, then it can be run with the name of the executable following by -
init.txt file and input.txt separated with a space as mentioned in the second line of the commands. 
Also, both init and input text files must be added in the same directory and same path where the -
project2.c is located. Since I also included the executable file inside the folder, the first line of -
the command can be skipped and can be run simply by using the second line command.
In order to run the project on Command Prompt or Terminal you need to use these commands below:

		gcc project2.c -o project2
		project2 init.txt input.txt
