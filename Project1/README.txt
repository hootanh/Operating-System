I wrote project 1 in the Python Programming Language and it consists of 4 .py files. 
The main file is Project1.py for execution and the other 3 .py files are the sub modules and classes.
The Input Text File must be added in the same directory and same path where the Project1.py is located.

In order to run the project on Command Prompt or Terminal you need to use either of these commands below, -
it depends on your Python version which you have on your system:

		python Project1.py input.txt
			or
		python3 Project1.py input.txt
